# Steps to install

- USE THIS COMMAND TO GET THE LATEST PACKAGE, because I update it constantly `pip install --upgrade armangrewal007`
- Type `armangrewal007` in your terminal to see my resume!

For Debian based environments, you can' do `pip install armangrewal007` because Debian considers it is an externally managed package. <br>
1. Create a venv using `python3 -m venv venv` &rarr; `source venv/bin/activate` &rarr; `pip3 install armangrewal007`
2. Use pipx `sudo apt install pipx` &rarr; `pipx install armangrewal007`

_... `.deb` version is coming soon, to prevent this hassle_
